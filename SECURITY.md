# Security and deployment

This is developer tooling, not a hardened public remote-control service.

- The control server intentionally has no app-layer pairing password. Anyone
  with network access to the app-facing routes can request sessions or status,
  and anyone with loopback/tunnel access to the controller can request
  screenshots or input. Run it locally, on Tailscale, or behind an equivalent
  private authenticated transport.
- Local development uses unencrypted ws/HTTP on a trusted network. A VPS needs
  TLS, protected controller access, firewall configuration, and careful proxy
  routing. Do not expose all routes or forward raw development ports publicly.
- A reverse proxy connects from loopback and can defeat loopback-only route
  checks if it forwards administrative paths. Allow only the app paths documented
  in control_server/README.md and reject browser origins.
- The USB tool uses a flash-time input-device secret for mutating routes. The
  control server stores the same secret and sends it to the iPad app only after
  accepting a session. USB HTTP is still plaintext on the local USB network, so
  do not treat this as a high-assurance hardware security module.
- Session authorization is in server memory and expires on restart. Pending
  permits expire after two minutes; active sessions end on disconnect. No
  disconnected or uncertain command is automatically retried.
- End Session revokes new commands before waiting for HID cleanup. Network loss
  or a held input can delay confirmation. Unplug the tool when an input stop is
  unconfirmed. Live Activity dismissal alone does not stop input.
- Screenshots can contain sensitive data. The CLI writes them to the private
  state directory until you remove them. Server logs, measurement traces, and
  device runtime data is local, not a release fixture.
- The MCP adapter is no-auth by design for private tunnel prototyping and binds
  to `127.0.0.1` by default. If a Tailscale-native agent needs direct access,
  bind it to the Tailscale IP with `MCP_ALLOW_TAILNET=1` and rely on Tailnet
  ACLs as the access boundary. Do not expose it through Funnel or the public
  internet. Use a private tunnel or add OAuth before remote/public deployment.
- No multi-user isolation, role-based access, per-agent permissions, or
  production rate limiting is implemented yet.

Do not publish `.state/`, `.tools/`, `.local/`, `build/`, `.signing.env`, signing
certificates, provisioning profiles, or screenshots. Run `npm run release:check`
and use `npm run release:pack` for an allowlisted source archive.

Before a public release, review third-party notices, verify Live Activity
lifecycle on a physical iPad, and audit any added
MCP/remote-controller transport separately.
